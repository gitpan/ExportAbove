ExportAbove version 0.02
========================

ExportAbove is a helper module for Exporter.

ExportAbove sets your module's subroutine or variable (scalar, array or hash) 
names into @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK or %EXPORT_TAGS automatically. You do not have 
to write '@EXPORT = qw(...);' and so on. Instead write 'use ExportAbove;' 
below the subroutine or variable definitions you want to export. 

You do not have to write same subroutine or variable names twice at 
'@EXPORT = qw(...);' and its definition. It makes module maintenance easy. 
If you want to change an exported names, you simply change only its 
definitions. If you want to move an exported subroutine or variable to 
another related module, simply do it.
